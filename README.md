# A toy app - creating an online shop with Angular

## How to use:

Firstly run the site locally by typing:
  http-server

To visit the site in your browser visit:
  index.html

To run feature tests simply run:
  protractor test/e2e/conf.js

To have the unit tests auto run:
  karma start test/karma.conf.js

##Â Notes

Factory - Use service instead to call RESTful api.

Would use product Id stored in db not index.

Would only update totals upon checkout in production. Save server calls - user changes mind.

Following common practice only allow one voucher, second replaces first.

Multiple orders same item

Valid vouchers would be a api call to backend in production

To prevent users adding OOS items, don't render button, also don't allow in controller.
